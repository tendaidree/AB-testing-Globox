# A/B Testing for Globox Webpage

This project aims to evaluate and improve the performance of the food and drink offerings section on Globox's mobile website. An A/B test was conducted to highlight key products, with the goal of increasing conversion rates and revenue. The experiment ran for 13 days with a total of 48,943 users divided between two groups: Group A and Group B.

## Experiment Context
The experiment aimed to promote food and drink offerings on the mobile site to increase user engagement and sales. By showing different banners and product highlights to users, the experiment measured the impact on conversion rates and overall revenue generated from purchases.


## Recommendations
Launch Group Bâ€™s version of the feature across the platform, as it outperformed Group A in conversion rates with minimal cost differences.
Increase sample size and extend the duration of the test to validate results further.
The low cost of implementing Group B's feature suggests a positive cost-benefit.

## Key Findings
Group A (24,343 users): Conversion rate of 3.92% with an average spend of $3.37 per user.
Group B (24,600 users): Conversion rate of 4.63% with an average spend of $3.39 per user.

Conversion Increase: Group B showed an 18% improvement in conversion rate compared to Group A.
No significant difference in the average amount spent between the two groups.
